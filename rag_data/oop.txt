Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
An object represents a real-world entity by combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Instead of writing a sequence of instructions, OOP focuses on modeling systems using interacting objects.

1. Core Concepts

Class:
A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

Object:
An object is an instance of a class with actual values stored in memory.

2. The Four Pillars of OOP

Encapsulation:
Bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access to internal data.

Abstraction:
Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features.

Inheritance:
Allowing a class to acquire properties and methods from another class.

Polymorphism:
Enabling the same method to behave differently depending on the object type.

3. How OOP Works

Objects communicate with each other through method calls.
Each object is responsible for managing its own state and behavior.

4. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Better code organization
- Reusability
- Easier maintenance

Disadvantages:
- Higher complexity
- Requires deeper design planning
