Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm based on a sequence of procedures or functions.
The program executes instructions in a fixed, top-down order.

1. Core Concepts

Procedures (Functions):
Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

Variables:
Data is stored separately from functions and shared when needed.

Execution Flow:
Instructions are executed step by step in a defined order.

2. How Procedural Programming Works

The main function controls program flow.
Smaller functions are called to perform individual tasks.
Data flows through return values.

3. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Simple and easy to learn
- Clear execution flow
- Efficient for small programs

Disadvantages:
- Poor scalability
- Difficult maintenance for large systems
- Weak data protection
