Event-Driven Programming (EDP) is a programming paradigm where the flow of execution is determined by events.
An event can be a user action such as a mouse click or key press, a system-generated trigger like a timer, or a message received from another program.

Unlike traditional procedural programs that follow a fixed, sequential order, event-driven programs remain in a waiting state until an event occurs. Once an event happens, the program reacts by executing a specific piece of logic associated with that event.

1. Core Components

Event:
An event represents a specific action or occurrence, such as a button click, data arrival, or file upload.

Event Loop:
The event loop is a continuous loop that listens for incoming events. It runs in the background and waits efficiently until an event occurs.

Event Source (Trigger):
The event source is the component that generates the event, such as a graphical button, a network socket, or a hardware sensor.

Event Handler (Callback):
The event handler is a function or method that is executed in response to a specific event.

2. How Event-Driven Programming Works

Initialize:
The program defines which events it is interested in and registers handlers for those events.

Wait:
The program enters the event loop and stays idle while consuming minimal system resources.

Detect:
An event occurs, such as a user clicking a button.

Dispatch:
The event loop identifies the event and forwards it to the corresponding handler.

Execute:
The event handler runs the required logic.

Repeat:
After execution, the program returns to the event loop and waits for the next event.

3. Real-World Applications

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs):
Operating systems and applications rely on events such as clicks and keyboard input.

Web Servers:
Event-driven servers like Node.js handle multiple requests efficiently using a single event loop.

Games:
Game engines use events for user input, collisions, and animations.

4. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- High responsiveness
- Efficient resource usage
- Easy extension by adding new events

Disadvantages:
- Non-linear execution flow
- Harder debugging in complex systems
- Event dependency complexity
